  //    description : "Each documented journey sits as it's own category, with Colorado recently wrapping up, and more categories and stories coming in the future. Challenges building ClintValentine.com included constraints on content updating - where the author would have limited device and internet access when traveling, as well as mobile device support regarding how does a site balance large photographs with mobile support. Clint Valentine was recently featured in an article on National Geographic's website, as well as tweeted about by President Aoun, the president of Northeastern.",
