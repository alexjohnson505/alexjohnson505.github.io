    <p class="serif long light">This project was inspired by the chaotic, yet beautiful nature of organic creatures. I wanted to create an interactive experience that used this theme as a gameplay mechanic.</p>

<p class="serif long quote">"A significant property of life-like behavior is unpredictability over moderate time scales... It would be all but impossible to predict which direction they will be moving (say) five minutes later... This property is unique to complex systems and contrasts with both chaotic behavior… and ordered … behavior. This fits with Langton's 1990 observation that life-like phenomena exist poised at the edge of chaos.”</p>

<p class="serif long">Reynolds was influenced by the animal motions of flocks such as birds, or fish schools. Reynolds referred to his generic simulated flocking creatures as Boids.</p>

<p class="serif long">This project is inspired by Craig Reynolds' research in modeling flocking behaviour. </p>

<p class="serif long">To develop an experimental visualization of swarm behaviour. I wanted to create an interactive visualization of flocking behaviour. This project was inspired by Craig Reynold’s work in creating algorithms to emulate the behaviour of organic creatures.</p>

<p class="serif long">I wanted the experience to instill a sense of 'companionship' with the other creatures in your swarm. I purposefully reduced the turn speed, and turn radius of the player fish. This forces the player into a movement scheme similar to his neighbors. As a result of slower turning radius, the player must collect, and rely on the fish in their swarm to make a difference in the environment.</p>
