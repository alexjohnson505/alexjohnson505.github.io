  //    summary : "EverTrue's Admin Management Portal is a client-facing web tool for customizing and editing app settings for EverTrue's mobile applications.",
  //    description : "EverTrue is a mobile platform developer, working to strengthen alumni relationships through the intersection of mobile applications, institutional knowledge, and social media such as LinkedIn. As a web development co-op at EverTrue, I worked alongside their product lead to prepare their Admin Management Portal. The Admin Management Portal is a self-service tool for clients and admins. Leveraging Backbone.js, underscore.js and a PHP/MySQL powered internal API we brought this single page javascript web app from being used internally used, to a client-facing self-service tool. I held responsibility over a variety of features, such as the landing pages, authentication aesthetics and UX, maintaining the bootstrap based style guide, investigating bug reports from client services, responsive design, and the management page for suggested updates. Working alongside and coordinating product development between iOS, Android, Backend, and Client Services provided to be a rewarding part of the job.",
