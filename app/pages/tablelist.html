<p class="serif long">Tablelist is a Boston-based tech startup focused on providing a centralized platform for nightlife. Tablelist offers mobile and web apps for discovering events, and customizing reservations at nightclubs, lounges, bars and restaurants across the US. </p>

<p class="serif long"><i>Tablelist started around a kitchen table.</i> Our goal was to use tech to improve the experience of <i>Going Out</i>. Can technology solve the was all too common with nightlife? We aimed to build solutions to make the experience more efficient and transparent. </p>

<p class="serif long">We started as a mobile marketplace for VIP tables. A niche market. A reservation for multiple guests, that would grant them the ability to skip the line and provide a dedicated server for the night if the group was willing to pre-pay their bar tab.</p>

<p class="serif long">As we expanded markets, starting in Boston, adding New York City, we built a platform for ticketing. Before we knew it, we were competing with the likes of EventBrite and TicketMaster. </p>

<p class="serif long">I built out our admin portal. A set of internal data management, marketing, and tracking tools to provide better real time support for users throughout the night. </p>

<p class="serif long">We added customizable embedded widgets for our venue partners. Allowing them (many for the first time) to empower users to purchase and make reservations directly from their website. Our primary competitor at this point of time was the clubâ€™s employee responsible for answering the phone throughout the day. </p>

<p class="serif long">In 2016 we acquired <a href="/nightpro.html">NightPro</a>, adding tools for our venue partners themselves to manage their inventory in real time - a task that was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170120-why-paper-is-the-real-killer-app" target="_blank">more often than not done on a clipboard.</a></p>
