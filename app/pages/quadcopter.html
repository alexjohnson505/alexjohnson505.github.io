    description : "As summer challenge, I worked with Nate Lilienthal to build a remote controllable Arduino-powered Quadcopter from scratch.",
  //    title : "Quadcopter Project",
  //    summary: "Our goal was to develop an autonomous Quadcopter, capable of navigating in 3-dimensional space, ultimately leading to opportunities in mapping and aerial photography.",
  //    description : "A quadcopter, also known as a quadrotor helicopter, is an instrument lifted and propelled by four rotors. Compared to traditional 2-propellor helipcopter solutions, quadcopters have become increasingly popular due to their stability and maneuverability. Nate Lilienthal, Dan Calacci, and I worked together to research parts, then purchase and assemble the structure. In addition, we experimented with new math concepts such as kalman filters and quaternions, and played with ruby and C++ on Arduino. The project is still a work in progress;  though capable of flight, our 'in-development' stabilization algorithm needs more work before we attempt higher altitudes ",
