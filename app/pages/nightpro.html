<p class="serif long strong">NightPro is a venue management platform for nightclubs, lounges, bars and restaurants.</p>

<p class="serif long">Whether it is event management, tracking customers, or organizing staff and promoters, NightPro offers a cross platform solution to maintaining accurate and up to date information throughout the night.</p>

<p class="serif long"><i>NightPro was born in Miami.</i> Built for the managers and hosts of nightclubs and lounges, NightPro aimed to replace clipboards as the go-to tool for tracking inventory and customers.</p>

<p class="serif long">Publish upcoming events, sell tickets and sell tables directly from your website. Control ticket pricing and table availability in real time. Use the customer CRM to identify repeat customers, and maintain their history and preferences across venues. Reserve table locations, and access inventory availability in real time. </p>

<p class="serif quote">Within 3 years, NightPro has helped to manage over $250,000,000 in reservations and over 4 million guests across 10 countries and 22 cities. </p>

<p class="serif long">In 2016, NightPro <a href="https://blog.nightpro.co/nightpro-acquired-by-tablelist/" target="_blank">joined</a> <a href="/tablelist.html">Tablelist</a> to connect venue and patrons to the most incredible nightlife experiences around the world.</p>

<p class="serif long">I worked on a number of embedded widgets for our venue parters. Allow customers to purchase tickets and tables directly from the venues website. No more calling the venue, or waiting on the response from "request forms". No-shows went down. Pre-paid reservations helped venues to accurated account for their occupancy and reservations - reducing waisted inventory.</p>
