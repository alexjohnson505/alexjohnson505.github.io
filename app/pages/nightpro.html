  <p class="serif long">I worked on a number of embedded widgets for our venue parters. Allow customers to purchase tickets and tables directly from the venues website. No more calling the venue, or waiting on the response from "request forms". No-shows went down. Pre-paid reservations helped venues to accurated account for their occupancy and reservations - reducing waisted inventory.</p>
