<p class="serif long">TextureChannel.com is a Subscription service offered by Texture Technologies as a solution to remote video training. Users are issued an account, where they can view training videos for the TA.XT2 Plus and Texture Measurement Software.</p>
<p class="serif long">I have been working with Texture Technologies for a long time to produce tutorials of their instruments and software. I convinced Texture Technologies that the best method for distributing the video list to subscribed clients would be an account-based video streaming site. A single point of access for Texture Technologies' training videos would be the most convenient and enjoyable for the user, as well as  cost-effective and easy to maintain for Texture Technologies. Not only did I assist in filming, editing, and producing the video work, but I developed the website used to organize and stream the videos. The site itself pulls the video list and meta data from a MySQL database, and uses PHP Sessions and another MySQL table of user records to authenticate user. Admins can create new user accounts and set an access expiration date for subscribers. The site uses AJAX to dynamically load the content and generate the ordered menu of available content at login.</p>
