  <h5>The Story</h5>
  <h2>Company Culture</h2>

  <p class="serif long">A strong community in the workplace is the driving force behind a great company culture. It is the top reason employees are engaged and stay longer at their company. CultureHQ aims to help manage and measure workplace community. Our goal was to help companies build meaningful connections between their employees through their shared interests, events, and activities. In turn, employees are happier, more engaged, and don't want to leave.</p>
