I then ported these e-mails into hubspot and mailchimp compatible templates, where they would be used to send out mail to thousands of our users. The largest challenge was writing and testing HTML/CSS to be compatible among a wide variety of email clients. Everything from iPhone 5 and Gmail, through Outlook had to be supported",
