    <p class="serif long light">A strong community in the workplace is the driving force behind a great company culture. It is the top reason employees are engaged and stay longer at their company. CultureHQ is an early-state startup that aims to manage and measure workplace community. Our goal was to help companies build meaningful connections between their employees through their shared interests, events, and activities. In turn, employees are happier, more engaged, and don't want to leave.</p>

  <h5>My Work</h5>
  <h2>Head Product Development</h2>

  <p class="serif long">I worked to build integrations between the NightPro management platform, and consumer facing experiences. By creating a number of drop in plugins (“widgets”), our partners could provide real time data and pricing to potential customers - allowing customers to purchase tickets and tables directly from the venues website. </p>
