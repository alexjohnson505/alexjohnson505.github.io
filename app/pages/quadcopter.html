<p class="serif long">As summer challenge, I worked with Nate Lilienthal to build a remote controllable Arduino-powered Quadcopter from scratch.</p>
<p class="serif long">Our goal was to develop an autonomous Quadcopter, capable of navigating in 3-dimensional space, ultimately leading to opportunities in mapping and aerial photography.",
<p class="serif long">We experimented with new math concepts such as kalman filters and quaternions, and played with ruby and C++ on Arduino. The project is still a work in progress;  though capable of flight, our 'in-development' stabilization algorithm needs more work before we attempt higher altitudes "</p>
