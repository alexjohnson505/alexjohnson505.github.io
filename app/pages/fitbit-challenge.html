  //    summary : "EverTrue's FitBit Challenge is an online ranking and comparison tool for competative step-counting.",
  //    description : "EverTrue's 1,000,000 Step Challenge was a company wide fitness initiative to maintain a 10,000 steps per day average. When the FitBit Dashboard didn't provide the level of competitiveness that we desired, we took the initiative to build our own leaderboard and tracker website. The website accumulated data available through FitBit's API into a comparison of the entire team in relation to each other, complete with leaderboard, steps-to-go, average, tracking graphics and 1 vs. 1 profile comparison statistics. The site was built supporting retina and fluid layout to create a mobile-first experience.",
